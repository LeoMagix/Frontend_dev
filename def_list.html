		<h1>The Power of The Mind</h1>

		<p>
		People who to me embody the power of harnessing your mind and 
		mastering your thoughts.
		</p>

		<h2>Masters of the mind</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt>Nikola Tesla</dt>
			<dd>
				For me the greatest inventor that ever lived, and arguably
				the man with the most intelligent brain. Pioneered the AC 
				current that powers all the worlds electrical appliances and
				many mind-bending innovations impossible to fathom.
				Dubbed, "Master of Lightening", he made a great impact on the
				field of Electrical Engineering.
			</dd>

			<dt>Michael Jordan</dt>
			<dd>
				A basketball player who willed himself into definiton of 
				what the purest form of excellence in your work should 
				look like. His dogged determination, plain refusal to settle
				for defeat, psychotic work ethic, coupled with a ruthless desire
				to win and utter disrespect for fear turned him into the most 
				fearsome competitor.
			</dd>

			<dt>Elon Musk</dt>
			<dd>
				A modern day pioneer, genius and a example that every knowledge is
				acquirable if you really want to learn it. Highly resourceable, not
				scared of failure or scarred by mistakes, this attributes enable him 
				to see beyond the stratosphere of impossible that limit many potential
				minds of today.
